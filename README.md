# Lane_Line_Detection
Building a driving assistance system with lane detection, obstacle detection, and vehicle tracking for enhanced road safety.

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a Mobile-Based Driving Assistance System. The system provides real-time assistance to drivers by offering features such as:

- **Lane Detection:** Detects lane markings on the road and helps drivers stay within their lanes.

- **Obstacle Detection:** Alerts drivers about nearby obstacles or vehicles.

- **Vehicle Tracking:** Tracks nearby vehicles, providing information on relative speed and time to collision.
